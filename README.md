# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

This is a MERN book search engine. When you search for a title, author or topic, results that match the entered works will appear. This will allow users to find a book that they are hoping for or even find something new to discover.

In order to start the app locally, users will enter "npm run develop" at the top part of the directory, and the website should appear for functionality. When it is fully functional it will allow users to signup or login, and that will allow users to save books from a search result and delete books previously saved.

As of now the book search function works. Currently there is a little bit of trouble getting the signup and login functions to work, which also prevents me from seeing if books can be saved or deleted. Despite these shortcomings I'm proud of how much ground I made with this project, especially when I had difficulty understanding some of the concepts coming into this assignment.
